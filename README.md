# The Hulbert Files
# Java-Recipe-Manager
# Author: Eoghan Hulbert
# Version: 1.0

This was one of the first full applications I built in college as a final class 
project. This version does not have have a frontend GUI but can be run using the terminal
in the Java environement.

The purpose of this project was aimed at learning the basics of software dev
using Java programming language, such as building classes, objects, and
manipulating properties.

Due to the lack of database connection, this application will not store any
recipes once the application has been closed/exited.

v2.0

In the next iteration of this application, I plan to develop a front-end GUI
and database to store application data rather than local memory. Once these
items have been implemented, I will be able to add it to my online "Portal"
project to be hosted for testing as a web application.
